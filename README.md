# Akura: Adaptive Sinhala Learning for Early Childhood

## Overview

Akura is a research-driven, adaptive learning platform designed to support early childhood education for Sinhala-speaking children in Sri Lanka. The project integrates **gesture recognition, handwriting analysis, speech-based pronunciation feedback, and emotion-aware adaptation** to address long-standing limitations in traditional preschool education, such as rote memorization, large student–teacher ratios, and lack of personalized feedback.

The system is designed as a **mobile, offline-first application**, ensuring accessibility in resource-constrained and low-connectivity environments while maintaining strong privacy safeguards.

## Research Motivation

Early childhood learning in Sri Lanka faces several persistent challenges:

* Overreliance on rote learning and worksheets
* Limited personalization due to high student–teacher ratios
* Insufficient real-time corrective feedback
* Language barriers for bilingual or overseas Sinhala-speaking children
* Lack of culturally and linguistically adapted educational technologies

Akura addresses these gaps by combining **multimodal interaction** with **adaptive learning strategies**, grounded in early childhood education and human–computer interaction research.
